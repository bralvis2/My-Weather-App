 ## Bugs üêõ
 I had some trouble adding click events to the buttons that were created with Javascript. As of right now, the saved buttons are not functional. I also had some trouble rendering the buttons. It seems that the buttons are rendered from the array twice, then they disappear on reload. I would higly appreciate feedback on this specifically. 

 ## Credits & Resources
 I'd like to give thanks to my tutor Matthew for her help. I used many examples from the UT resources provided in class. As well as W3Schools and MDN.
